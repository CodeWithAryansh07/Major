# API Testing Error Summary

## Issues Found:

### 1. Authentication Endpoints (403 Forbidden)
- **POST /api/auth/register** - Getting 403 Forbidden instead of processing registration
- **POST /api/auth/login** - Getting 400 Bad Request (but would be 403 if registration worked)

### 2. Code Execution Endpoint (403 Forbidden)
- **POST /api/execute** - Getting 403 Forbidden, should be public

### 3. Individual Snippet Endpoint (403 Forbidden)
- **GET /api/snippets/{id}** - Getting 403 Forbidden, should be public for reading

### 4. Security Configuration Issues
- The current matchers in SecurityConfig are not properly configured
- Pattern `/api/snippets/*/` doesn't match individual snippet IDs properly
- Authentication endpoints should be open but are being blocked

### 5. Endpoints That ARE Working:
- **GET /api/health** - Working correctly ✅
- **GET /api/snippets/public** - Working correctly ✅ 
- **GET /api/snippets/search** - Working correctly ✅

## Root Cause:
The security configuration is not properly permitting the auth and individual snippet endpoints. Need to fix the RequestMatcher patterns in SecurityConfig.

## Next Actions:
1. Fix SecurityConfig patterns for auth endpoints
2. Add proper pattern for individual snippet GET endpoint
3. Ensure code execution endpoint is properly permitted
4. Restart server and re-test all endpoints
5. Test full authentication flow once auth endpoints work
